## 🎓 Project Overview

Peer Academy is a revolutionary educational platform that implements merit-based governance, peer evaluation, and philosophical consensus-building across a global network of physical settlements. This repository contains comprehensive technical specifications for building a platform that combines academic excellence with democratic participation through sophisticated algorithms and community-driven governance.

### 🌟 Core Innovation

**Student-Built Platform**: Reduces development costs by 60-80% while providing unparalleled real-world education and creating deep philosophical alignment between builders and users. High baseline — like many elite universities (MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Caltech, etc.), the average incoming programming student should already know how to code quite well.
